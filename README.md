# Final_PR - Machine Learning Project

This project implements various data preprocessing and classification techniques to analyze a dataset and predict binary outcomes. The goal is to apply machine learning algorithms with a focus on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and model evaluation.

## üìÅ Project Structure

- `Final_PR.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the complete implementation of data loading, preprocessing, PCA, model training, and evaluation.

## üß† Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Apply feature scaling and dimensionality reduction using PCA.
- Implement classification algorithms such as:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Evaluate models using metrics like:
  - Accuracy
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Precision, Recall, and F1-Score

## üìä Dataset

- **File**: `heart_disease.csv` *(you may need to download or provide this file)*
- **Description**: Contains patient data related to heart disease (e.g., age, cholesterol, blood pressure).
- **Target Variable**: Binary classification (presence or absence of heart disease).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

Make sure to install the required Python packages before running the notebook:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
